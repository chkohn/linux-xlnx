Xilinx HDMI TX Subsystem (Staging)

The Xilinx HDMI TX Subsystem contains several subcores to implement
a HDMI receiver. staging/xilinx/hdmi/xilinx_drm_hdmi.c implements a
DRM/KMS driver that slaves to xilinx_drm_drv.c in the output pipeline.

If xlnx,vtc-offset is given it specifies the offset of the built-in
VTC IP block. This is required for stand-alone operation.

Refer to xlnx,vphy.txt for the phy specifics.

retimer-clk is optional. If specified, the corresponding driver
should offer a CCF clock that supports .set_rate(). Through this,
the device can retime/redrive the HDMI TX signal on the connector
depending on the TX clock line rate.

phy-names must be hdmi-phy0 etc.
