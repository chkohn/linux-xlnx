Binding for Texas Instruments CDCE(L)913 programmable I2C clock generators.

Reference
This binding uses the common clock binding[1]. Details about the devices can be
found in the data sheet[2].

Required properties:
 - compatible: One of "ti,cdce913", "ti,cdcel913"
 - reg: I2C device address.
 - #clock-cells: From common clock bindings: Shall be 1.

Optional properties:
 - clock-output-names: From common clock bindings.
 - clock-frequency: Tuple of requested output frequencies <Y1, Y2, Y3>
 - ti,s0: State of the S0 config pin. Shall be 0 or 1.
 - ti,crystal-load-capacity: Value for the internal capacitor. Valid values
   range from 0 to 20 (inclusive).
 - ti,input-clock-type: Type of input clock. One of 'xtal, 'VCXO', 'LVCMOS'

Example:
	cdce913@65 {
	        #clock-cells = <1>;
	        clocks = <&xtal>;
		clock-frequency = <25000000>, <50000000>, <100000000>;
	        compatible = "ti,cdce913";
	        reg = <0x65>;
	        ti,s0 = <1>;
	        ti,input-clock-type = "xtal";
	};
